## Reveal Prompt: The Decentralized Prompt Engineering Toolbox (Subnet 395)

**Prompts are the new algorithm.**

**Reveal Prompt** is the most powerful, decentralized prompt engineering platform built as a Bittensor subnet (SN395 on Testnet). It is dedicated to **Reverse Prompt Engineering (RPE)**—the art and science of reconstructing the original input prompt that led to a specific Large Language Model (LLM) output.

We transform proprietary LLM outputs into reproducible, monetizable assets.

## The Problem: Massive Friction in AI Adoption

The shift from 'code' to 'context' causes friction:

**68% of professionals abandon AI tools** due to prompt-related frustrations, showing a need for better prompt intelligence. The inability to learn the successful input that created a successful output prevents rapid improvement for users.

## Economics & Sustainability

### Revenue Generation

Revenue comes from three channels:

1.  **Tool Usage Fees:** Charging a small fee for using Reverse Engineering and Prompt Optimization tools on **revealprompt.com**.
2.  **API Key Revenue:** Charging subscription/usage fees for programmatic access to tools and data via an **API key**.
3.  **Marketplace Commissions:** Taking a small fee on transactions in the Prompt Marketplace (buying and selling proven, high-ROI prompts).

### Subnet Sustainability (Post-Emission)

The subnet will be sustained by **user demand and usage fees**. These fees will reward miners and validators, ensuring the network operates and improves even without Bittensor TAO emissions, creating a direct link between user value and network profitability.

## Subnet Incentive Mechanism (Core Logic)

The system uses a decentralized network of competing validators and miners. Validators ensure output quality, while miners provide the distributed compute for RPE tasks.

### Data Flow: The Reverse Prompt Challenge

1.  **Challenge Issuance:** A **Validator** generates outputs from a hidden *ground-truth prompt* ($A$) and sends them to the miner network.
2.  **Miner Responses:** Multiple **Miners** (each running a different RPE model) compete to guess the original prompt and submit their candidate prompts ($P$).
3.  **Scoring and Consensus:** The **Validator** tests each candidate prompt by regenerating outputs and scoring how closely they match the originals. The Miner with the best-scoring prompt earns **TAO rewards** (or user fees).
4.  **Constantly Improving:** This competition rapidly refines the most effective RPE algorithms, increasing user ROI.

### Scoring Metrics for Prompt Accuracy

## Subnet Scoring Metric: Design Validation

This metric assesses design quality and effectiveness, rewarding **precision** and **semantic understanding**.

#### 1. Element-Level Accuracy (**60%**)
* **Color Recognition (10%):** Correct identification of primary colors and palettes.
* **Font Recognition (10%):** Accurate identification of font styles.
* **Layout Analysis (10%):** Precise detection of negative space and visual focal points.
* **Semantic Understanding (30%):** Correct interpretation of color palette meaning, font style intent, and visual importance/hierarchy.

#### 2. Overall Design Understanding (**40%**)
* **Style Classification (20%):** Accurate categorization of the overall design aesthetic (e.g., vintage, futuristic).
* **Visual Metaphor Interpretation (20%):** Correctly describing the abstract or metaphorical meaning of the design.

The validator assesses the subnet's ability to accurately identify and interpret both **explicit design attributes** and their **underlying semantic meaning** from design images.
