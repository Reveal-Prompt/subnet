## ✨ Reveal Prompt: The Decentralized Prompt Engineering Toolbox (Subnet 395)

**Prompts are the new algorithm.**

**Reveal Prompt** is the most powerful, decentralized prompt engineering platform built as a Bittensor subnet (SN395 on Testnet). It is dedicated to **Reverse Prompt Engineering (RPE)**—the art and science of reconstructing the original input prompt that led to a specific Large Language Model (LLM) output.

We transform proprietary LLM outputs into reproducible, monetizable assets.

## 🎯 The Problem: Massive Friction in AI Adoption

The shift from 'code' to 'context' has created new, high-value challenges:

* **Prompt Engineering Fatigue:** A significant number of professionals (68%) abandon AI tools due to prompt-related frustrations, demonstrating a clear need for better prompt intelligence.
* **Input Context is the New IP:** Proprietary source code has been replaced by proprietary input context, leading to threats like "prompt-stealing attacks."
* **Black Box Innovation:** The inability to learn the successful input that created a successful output prevents rapid iteration and improvement for millions of power users.

## 💰 Economics & Sustainability

### Revenue Generation

Our revenue is generated through three primary channels:

1.  **Tool Usage Fees:** Charging users a small fee for utilizing the Reverse Engineering and Prompt Optimization tools within the **revealprompt.com** application.
2.  **API Key Revenue:** Charging a subscription or usage-based fee for programmatic access to our tools and data via an **API key**.
3.  **Marketplace Commissions:** Taking a small commission fee on transactions made within the Prompt Marketplace (the buying and selling of proven, high-ROI prompts).

### Subnet Sustainability (Post-Emission)

The subnet will transition to being sustained by **user demand and usage fees**. The fees generated from application requests within our tools and marketplace will be used to reward the miners and validators, ensuring the network continues to operate and improve even without Bittensor TAO emissions. This creates a direct link between user value and network profitability.

## ⚙️ Subnet Incentive Mechanism (Core Logic)

The system relies on a decentralized network of competing validators and miners. Validators ensure the integrity and quality of the reverse prompt outputs, while miners provide the distributed compute required for complex reverse-engineering tasks.

### 🔄 Data Flow: The Reverse Prompt Challenge

1.  **Challenge Issuance:** A **Validator** generates a outputs from a hidden *ground-truth prompt* ($A$) and sends these outputs to the miner network as a challenge.
2.  **Miner Responses:** Multiple **Miners**—each running a different RPE model or algorithm—compete to guess the original prompt and submit their candidate prompts ($P$, the solution).
3.  **Scoring and Consensus:** The **Validator** tests each candidate prompt by regenerating outputs and scoring how closely they match the originals. The Miner that submits the best-scoring prompt earns **TAO rewards** (or fees from user tool usage).
4.  **Constantly Improving:** This competition incentivizes the rapid adoption and refinement of the most effective RPE algorithms, directly increasing the ROI for users.

### 📊 Scoring Metrics for Prompt Accuracy

## Subnet Scoring Metric: Design Validation

This metric assesses the quality and effectiveness of design elements, rewarding **precision** and **semantic understanding**.

#### 1. Element-Level Accuracy (**60%**)
* **Color Recognition (10%):** Correct identification of primary colors and their associated palettes.
* **Font Recognition (10%):** Accurate identification of font styles and types.
* **Layout Analysis (10%):** Precise detection of negative space and visual focal points.
* **Semantic Understanding (30%):** Correct interpretation of color palette meaning, font style intent, and visual importance/hierarchy.

#### 2. Overall Design Understanding (**40%**)
* **Style Classification (20%):** Accurate categorization of the overall design aesthetic (e.g., vintage, futuristic, fashion).
* **Visual Metaphor Interpretation (20%):** Correctly describing the abstract or metaphorical meaning conveyed by the design.

 The validator will present design images and assess the subnet's ability to accurately identify and interpret both **explicit design attributes** and their **underlying semantic meaning**.
