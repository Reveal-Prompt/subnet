# 🔍 Reveal Prompt

> Building the foundation for Verified Intelligence on Bittensor

Reveal Prompt (SNX) is a Bittensor subnet pioneering prompt revelation — the process of uncovering and reconstructing the hidden prompts behind AI-generated outputs. By revealing what instructions drive AI behavior, Reveal makes artificial intelligence transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy, directly supporting the Opentensor Foundation's mission of creating a decentralized intelligence network.

## 🎯 Overview

### How It Works

**Miners** receive AI-generated outputs from validators and work to reveal the hidden prompts that created them. Using advanced prompt discovery techniques, they analyze the outputs to reconstruct the original instructions that guided the AI's response. Once they've identified what they believe to be the hidden prompt, they submit their revelation back to the validator for assessment.

**Validators** generate AI outputs from hidden prompts and distribute these outputs to miners across the subnet as revelation challenges. When miners submit their revealed prompts, validators assess the quality and accuracy by testing whether the revealed prompts can reproduce the original outputs. They score miners based on multiple performance metrics including prompt accuracy, output reproducibility, completeness, and response time.

This continuous cycle of revelation and verification creates a decentralized system for making AI behavior transparent and accountable. Rewards are distributed based on how precisely miners can reveal the hidden prompts, with top performers receiving proportional TAO rewards during each emission period.

## 🎯 Miners and Validators Functionality

### Incentive Mechanism and Reward Structure

Reveal Prompt represents a significant stride in enhancing the Bittensor network, aiming to contribute to the world's largest peer-to-peer Verified Intelligence network by building a Proof-of-Inference system through prompt revelation. This initiative aligns with the Opentensor Foundation's criteria for innovative subnet solutions. By revealing the hidden prompts behind AI outputs, we enable verification that specific outputs were generated from specific prompts, thereby providing what we term as Proof-of-Inference through prompt transparency.

Reveal Prompt incentivizes miners and validators to contribute to the generation and validation of high-quality, accurate, and verifiable prompt revelations using a specialized reward mechanism that aligns with the unique aspects of prompt discovery and AI transparency. The incentive structure rewards miners who can most accurately reveal the hidden prompts that generated AI outputs, focusing on analytical capability and prompt understanding rather than raw computational power. This opens opportunities for diverse participants to contribute meaningful intelligence to the network.

The reward mechanism scores miners based on the accuracy and completeness of revealed prompts along with their ability to reproduce the original outputs, rather than solely on end results. This approach reduces the computational burden on validators as prompt verification can be efficiently performed by regenerating outputs from revealed prompts and comparing them to the originals.

#### Miners

- Receive AI-generated outputs from validators on the subnet
- Analyze outputs to reveal the hidden prompts that generated them using advanced prompt discovery techniques
- Return the revealed prompts to the requesting validator for validation and scoring

#### Validators

- Produce AI outputs from hidden prompts and distribute revelation requests to miners participating on the subnet
- Confirm that miners are revealing prompts accurately by testing whether revealed prompts reproduce the original outputs
- Score results from miners based on performance metrics such as prompt accuracy, output reproducibility, completeness, and response time
